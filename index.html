				<h5>Ms. Nathanael Frances Hipol, an Aeronautical Engineer by profession
				and a sneakerhead by heart, once dreamt of having her own shoe shop since she was in high school.
				She grew up in a province where being on trend was always a struggle, so when she had finished her
				schooling, she immediately planned for something big. Then suddenly, the word "hustle" struck her mind.
				It means "to have the courage, confidence, self belief, and self-determination to go out there and
				work it out until you find the opportunities you want in life." This word has inspired her for many
				years so she decided that it would be the perfect name for her business. HUSTLE was officially
				open to people last January 24, 2019, which is her special day.</h5>
